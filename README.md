Is a collection of 2 + 1 microservices:

- Trades Generation Service (TGS): Generating random trades continuously with a hashcode
- Hash recording Service (HRS): Listening to socket(trades + hashes) and committing them to an in memory database.
- Stats Recording service - polls all the services for commited trades

Communication is done by ZeroMQ, a push-pull model will be used:
- TGS -> publishing “TRADES with HASHCODES”
- HRS -> subscribes to the above feed and commits them to db


TO RUN:
1. ZeroMQ must be installed on the machine.
2. npm install
3. Setup variables in <b>ConfigData.json<b>
4. Fire up 1 instance of TGS
    <i>node TradeGenerationService.js</i>
5. Fire up 1 or more than 1 instance of HRS
    <i>node HashRecordingService.js</i>
6. Fire up 1 instance of stats gathering service
    <i>node StatsGatheringService.js</i>

    <b>NOTE: With more than 1 instace of the HRS do observe that the traffic generated by TGS is being distributed between the instances.</b>
