Is a collection of 3 microservices:
-Trades Generation Service (TGS): Generating random trades continuously.
-Hash Generation Service (HGS): Listening to events(trades) generated by TGS and generating a SHA of the trade.
-Hash recording Service (HRS): Listening to events(hashes) generated by HGS and committing them to persistent store / database.

-TGS -> pushing to “TRADES”
-HGS -> pulling from “TRADES” and pushing “SHA-CODES”
-HRS -> pulling from “SHA-CODES”
