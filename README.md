Micro Messaging Services

Is a collection of 3 microservices:
- Trades Generation Service (TGS): Generating random trades continuously.
- Hash Generation Service (HGS): Listening to events(trades) generated by TGS and generating a SHA of the trade.
- Hash recording Service (HRS): Listening to events(hashes) generated by HGS and committing them to persistent store / database.

Communication is done by ZeroMQ, a pub-sub model will be used:
- TGS -> publishing “TRADES”
- HGS -> subscribes to “TRADES” and publishes “SHA-CODES”
- HRS -> subscribes to “SHA-CODES”
