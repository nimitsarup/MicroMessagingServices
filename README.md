Micro Messaging Services

Is a collection of 3 microservices:
- Trades Generation Service (TGS): Generating random trades continuously.
- Hash Generation Service (HGS): Listening to events(trades) generated by TGS and generating a SHA of the trade.
- Hash recording Service (HRS): Listening to events(hashes) generated by HGS and committing them to persistent store / database.

Communication is done by ZeroMQ, a pub-sub model will be used:
- TGS -> publishing “TRADES”
- HGS -> subscribes to “TRADES” and publishes “SHA-CODES”
- HRS -> subscribes to “SHA-CODES”


TO RUN:
1. ZeroMQ must be installed on the machine.
2. npm install
3. Fire up 1 instance each of TGS and HRS
    <i>node TradeGenerationService.js
    node HashRecordingService.js</i>
4. Fire up 1 or more than 1 instance of HGS
    <i>node HashGenerationService.js</i>

    <b>NOTE: With more than 1 instace of the HGS do observe that the traffic generated by TGS is being distributed between the instances.</b>

THINGS BEING WORKED ON:
- Backend database to commit generated hashes.
- Service to monitor load, traffic and other vital stats (using molecular metrics).
